Rising sea levels, increased frequency of extreme weather events, and ocean acidification are some of the key challenges facing these delicate environments. Coastal ecosystems, such as mangroves, salt marshes, and coral reefs, provide critical services including storm protection, habitat for marine life, and support for local economies.  One of the most noticeable effects of climate change is the rise in sea levels, which leads to coastal erosion and loss of habitat. Mangroves and salt marshes, which act as natural barriers against storm surges, are increasingly at risk. Additionally, ocean acidification, caused by the absorption of excess carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, is threatening coral reefs, which are vital for marine biodiversity.]
